## 👥 Users Posts App

A simple application that displays a list of users. When clicking on any user, it fetches and shows the posts related to that user.

The project was implemented in two different ways:
- ✅ Using **Fetch API**
- ✅ Using **Axios**

---

### 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal is to compare Fetch API and Axios in terms of:
- Ease of use
- Code structure
- Error handling

---

### 🧪 Data Source (API)

The project uses a free fake REST API from:
